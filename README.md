Remora.Neos.Headless
====================

# Archived
Remora.Neos.Headless has been archived with the release and announcement of
Resonite, NeosVR's spiritual and technical successor. This repository will
remain open to the public in a read-only state, and all new development will
take place [here](https://github.com/Nihlus/Crystite).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains two projects - a custom headless server for NeosVR, and
a mod for the stock NeosVR headless client that implements a REST API for 
programmatic control of its features.

To get started with the custom headless server, go [here][1].

To get started with the REST API mod, go [here][2].
